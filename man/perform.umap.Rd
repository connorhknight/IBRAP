\arguments{
\item{object}{IBRAP S4 class object}

\item{assay}{Character. String containing indicating which assay to use}

\item{reduction}{Character. String defining which reduction to supply to the UMAP algorithm. Default = NULL}

\item{graph}{Character. If you wish to UMAP project a previously created connectivity graph (i.e. BBKNN output) supply the graph name here with reductions set to NULL. Default = NULL}

\item{reduction.name.suffix}{Character. What should be appended to the end of umap as the reduction name.}

\item{n_components}{Numerical. How many UMAP dimensions should be produced, if you are supplying graphs, only 2 dimensions can be produced. Default = 3}

\item{n_neighbors}{Numerical. How many neighbours should be identified per cell. A higher value typically returns more accurate results. Default =}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should system information be printed. Default = FALSE}

\item{seed}{Numeric. What should the seed be set as. Default = 1234}

\item{...}{Numerical. Arguments to be passed to Seurat::RunUMAP}

\item{n.dims}{Numerical. The number of UMAP dimensions to be produced. Must be supplied in list format relative to the order of reductions}
