 **I**ntegrated **B**enchmarking single-cell **R**NA-sequencing **A**utomated **P**ipeline endeavours to make optimal bioinformatic pipelines preconstructed into an ease-of-use tool, alongside providing gold-standard metrics to assess their effectiveness.
 
Welcome to IBRAPs tutorial page! IBRAP is a wrapper for most used and highly recommended single-cell pipelines and analytical components in Python and R. Furthermore, our tool is easy to use and automates the installation of nearly 60 packages and their dependencies for you convenience. We also produced a novel S4 class object in R that contains all of these numerous pipelines that you generate in IBRAP for easy access with access functions to interpret your data. We generated numerous tutorial pages to guide you through the process of using our tool which can be found in the link below:
